## Overview

A wearable + mobile solution designed to help users manage sudden anxiety attacks in real-time through real-time heart rate monitoring and guided calming exercises.
This project was built as part of a design + tech assignment where we had to conceptualize, prototype, and build a real-world application to address a pressing mental health challenge. We created a wearable anxiety relief system using a pulse-detecting glove (built with Arduino Uno and a pulse sensor) and a Python-based desktop application (Tkinter) to guide users through sound therapy, journaling, and breathing exercises when high pulse rates were detected.

## Features

- **Real-time pulse detection using pulse sensor + Arduino Uno**
- **Personalized sound therapy**
- **Guided breathing exercises**
- **Digital journaling interface**
- **Minimalist UI for low cognitive load**

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware: Arduino Uno, Pulse Sensor**
- **App Framework: Python (Tkinter GUI)**
- **Research	Surveys, Interviews, User Testing**

## Research Highlights

- **Top Triggers: Academic pressure, performance, and social situations**
- **Coping Preferences: Deep breathing, listening to music, talking to someone**
- **Behavioral Insight: Most users do not consistently track their pulse**
