## Overview

Developed a 2D physics-based game using Java, libGDX, and Gradle with interactive sprites and collision mechanics.

🎯 LibGDX Framework
The backbone of the project. Handles cross-platform development, rendering, audio, input, physics, and more.

Allowed deployment on desktop (and potentially Android).

💣 Box2D Physics Engine
Used to simulate realistic physics (gravity, collisions, mass, restitution).

Made the bird launching, object tumbling, and pig-smashing feel natural(ish).

Also where half the bugs came from 

🧠 Scene2D / Scene2D.UI
Managed different game scenes like menu, gameplay, pause, etc.

Helped organize UI elements like buttons, score counters, and retry prompts.

🎨 Texture Atlases & Sprite Sheets
Used for efficient loading and rendering of bird, pig, and block animations.

Packed using TexturePacker.

🖱️ InputProcessor / GestureDetector
For slingshot control: dragging, stretching, and releasing the bird.

Mapped touch/mouse input to fling vectors.

🔊 Audio Integration
Sound effects for bird flings, pig grunts, crashes, and satisfying destruction.

Managed using AssetManager.

🛠️ AssetManager
Helped avoid memory leaks by loading/unloading assets smartly.

Basically stopped the game from turning into a laggy slideshow.

🔄 Game Loop & State Management
Custom game loop controlled the update-render cycle.

States like PLAYING, PAUSED, WON, LOST for clear transitions.

🐞 DebugRenderer
Showed physics bodies and collision boxes visually.

Helped tremendously in fixing random janky launches.
