## Overview

IThis repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2022.

This project is a robotic vehicle that needs to drive autonomously on a parkour that randomly changes each round. I used the Lego MINDSTORMS EV3 robotics kit to build the vehicle. The main brick, i.e., control center and power station for the robot is connected to two color sensors, one ultrasonic sensor and one gyro sensor. It has a steering actuator powered by a medium motor and a rear-wheel drive powered by a large motor. I programmed the robot to estimate the state of the parkours and navigate the desired path through the different sensors attached to it.

## Technologies Used

- **Submitted at the World Robotics Olympiad Nationals 2022.**
- **This project was placed 4th Nationwide.**

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between code structures, as well as managing edge cases. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.
